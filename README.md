# Multiple-Linear-Regression-and-Regression-Diagnostics-in-R
Files associated with my multiple linear regression project

I have used the marketing data set [datarium package], which contains the impact of the amount of money spent(in dollars) on three advertising medias (youtube, facebook and newspaper) on sales(units).

The following steps are performed

1.) Loading the Dataset

2.) Exploratory Data Analysis

3.) Building a Model

4.) Model Accuracy Assessment

5.) Verifying if assumptions of Ordinary Least Squares Regression are met

 The assumptions are:
 1. Linearity
 2. Homoscedasticity
 3. No Autocorrelation
 4. Normality
 5. No Multicollinearity
 6. No Outliers
 7. No Endogenity
 
6.) Conclusion
